# PHP AVL binary search tree #

<strong>Coming soon!</strong>

A set of PHP classes implementing management of binary search trees that 
comply to AVL rules. The API exposes tree management operations (insert, 
replace, delete, find), in-order traversal (find, first, last, prev, 
next, curr). Nodes within the trees are not exposed publicly. Tree and 
traversal operations implement relaxed balance factors, and 
parent-pointer node structures. Hooks for node comparison, error 
handling and logging capabilities are provided via a callback interface. 

A detailed description of AVL trees be found at on Wikipedia at [AVL tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree).
