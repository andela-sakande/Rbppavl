# PHP AVL binary search tree - COMING SOON! #

A set of PHP classes implementing binary search trees that comply to AVL 
rules. 
The API exposes methods for tree operations (insert, replace, delete, 
find), and for inorder traversal (find, first, last, prev, next, curr). 
Tree and traversal operations implement relaxed balance factors, and 
parent pointer node structures. 
Hooks for node comparison, error handling and diagnostic logging 
capabilities are provided via a callback interface. 

<strong>What are AVL trees?</strong>
In an nutshell, AVL trees are a form of binary search trees that can be 
used to keep a set of data efficiently sorted while adding or removing 
elements. 
For more details, Wikipedia has articles for [binary search trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) 
and [AVL trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree). 

<strong>What about 'relaxed balance factors'?</strong>
Without getting into all the theory, AVL trees in their 'canonical 
form', i.e. where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node 
differ by at most one, are very efficient for lookup, but require in 
average a rotation operation every two insert or delete operations. By 
default, Rbppavl handles trees in canonical AVL form, but optionally 
allows to 'relax' the balancing factor, allowing the height difference 
to be any integer value. Empirical evidence shows that, in average, each 
increase of the allowed imbalance almost _halves_ the number of 
rotations expected. On the other side, the overall height of the tree 
will increase and lookup operations become less efficient. 

<strong>What about parent pointer node structures?</strong>
In Rbppavl, each node in the tree stores a link to its 'parent' node. 
This allows to simplify traversal by eliminating the need for a stack, 
i.e. given a node, getting to previous or next inorder node can be 
accomplished just with the information stored in the node itself.

# Usage examples #

<strong>Basic usage example</strong>

1. Include Rbppavl

    require_once 'Rbppavl/Rbppavl.php';

2. Define your data object and the callback interface to be used by Rbppavl

	class TestObject {
		public $q;
	}

	class TestCallback implements RbppavlCbInterface    {

		public function compare($a, $b)    {
			return ($a->q == $b->q) ? 0 : (($a->q < $b->q) ? -1 : 1);
		}

		public function dump($a)    {
			return $a->q;
		}

		public function diagnosticMessage($severity, $id, $text, $params, $qText,$className = null) {
			return null;
		}

		public function errorHandler($id, $text, $params, $qText, $className = null) {
			return null;
		}
	}

3. Create a tree

	$tree = new RbppavlTree('TestCallback');

4. Insert some data objects 

	$seq = array(12, 7, 36, 4, 1, 28, 3);
    foreach ($seq as $value) {
        $data = new TestObject;
        $data->q = $value;
        $t = $tree->insert($data); 
    }

5. Perform inorder traversal, printing each value

	$trav = new RbppavlTraverser($tree);
	$r = $trav->first();
	while ($r != NULL)    {
		print($r->q . '<br/>');
        $r = $trav->next();
	}
